# jqwicket

This is a clone of github repository jesselong/jqwicket. 
(A huge thanks to Jesse for bringing the latest version of jqwicket to github)

I will be using this repository to maintain my own tweaks, bugfixes and components in jqwicket. 
I will send a pull request to Jesse for the code changes that I consider to be useful for others.
